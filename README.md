# Pizza-Caclulator
I made this because I read on reddit that 1 18" pizza is larger than 2 12" pizza's.

After first I didnt think this was true as 12 + 12 = 24 so 2 12" pizza's has to be larger.

However if you do the calcultaions then it turns out true that 1 18" pizza is greater than 2 12" pizza's.

I wrote a simple ruby script that works this out.
